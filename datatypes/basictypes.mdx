Basic DataTypes
===

Like any regular programming language, Type-C provides basic built-in
data types. These types have a guaranteed fixed size, ensuring that the
data they represent occupies a constant amount of memory, regardless of
the platform. This is crucial for low-level operations and provides more
predictable behavior for high-performance computing tasks.


|**Name** |**Explanation**| **Range**|
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|`u8`| 8bit wide unsigned integer|0 to 255|
|`i8`|8-bit wide signed integer|-128 to 127|
|`u16`|16-bit wide unsigned integer|0 to 65,535|
|`i16`|16-bit wide signed integer|                                              -32,768 to 32,767|
|`u32`|32-bit wide unsigned integer  |0 to 4,294,967,295|
|`i32`|32-bit wide signed integer|                                            -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|
|`u64`|64-bit wide unsigned integer|                                              0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615|
|`i64`|64-bit wide signed integer|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|
|`f32`|32-bit wide floating  number|                                           3.4 × 10^38 (7 digits)|
|`f64`|64-bit wide floating point number |1.7 × 10^308 (15 digits)|
|`bool`|Boolean value (8-bit sized)      |`true` or `false`|
|`void`|Usually a return type for functions that has no return value| |
|`null`|Used both as a type and a value, to indicate that an object is nullable||

Type-C does not provide C compatibility types for basic types, instead, `u8` is compatible with C99 
`uint8_t`, same for all others.

## Type Casting between basic types
Type casting in not an instant instruction, inorder to attempt to maintain type safety, Type-C will 
cast an intermediate type to the target type. This is to prevent loss of data or unexpected results, 
when applicable.

For example:
```tc
let x: f32 = 1f
let z: u8 = x as u8
```

In the above example, `x` is a floating point number, and `z` is an unsigned integer. The compiler will first
convert x into u32, then to u8.
