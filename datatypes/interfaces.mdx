Interfaces
===

Interfaces in Type-C serve to define contracts for classes or types. These contracts, specified as sets of method signatures, ensure that the types adhering to the interface fulfill certain roles within the system.
Hence, given this nature, interfaces types and structure has to be concrete, which sets some limits on what is acceptable in an interface.

Here is an overview of interface constraints:
- Interfaces cannot have fields
- Interfaces supports method's overloading
- Interfaces supports generics
- Interfaces supports operator overloading
- Interfaces cannot have static methods
- Interfaces cannot have constructors (`init` methods)

# Basic Interface Example

Let's consider the common `Iterable` interface, frequently employed across various programming languages to denote types that can be iterated over.

```tc
type Iterable<T> = interface {
    fn iterator() -> Iterator<T>  // Returns an iterator object
}

type Iterator<T> = interface {
    fn hasNext() -> bool  // Checks for more elements
    fn next() -> T        // Fetches the next element
}
```

Here, the `Iterable` interface requires a method `iterator()` that must return an object conforming to the `Iterator` interface. The `Iterator` interface then outlines the essential methods for iteration.

## Implementing Interfaces

The following example demonstrates the implementation of `Iterable` and `Iterator` for an array data structure:

```tc
type ArrayIterator<T> = class Iterator<T> {
    let array: Array<T>
    let currentIndex: u32

    fn init(array: Array<T>) {
        this.array = array
        this.currentIndex = 0
    }

    fn hasNext() -> bool {
        return this.currentIndex < this.array.length
    }

    fn next() -> T {
        let element = this.array[this.currentIndex]
        this.currentIndex += 1
        return element
    }
}

type Array<T> = class Iterable<T> {
    let elements: T[]

    fn init(elements: T[]) {
        this.elements = elements
    }

    fn iterator() -> Iterator<T> {
        return ArrayIterator<T>(this.elements)
    }
}
```

Interface inheritance on the other hand is allowed. But it recommended to be used with scare to avoid bloated classes where a lot of methods will have to be defined.
