Tuples data types are not directly used by the user, they are used as a mechanism to allow functions to return multiple values.

Tuples are expected only when when parsing function return types, and are not used in any other context.

```tc
fn doStuff(x: u32) -> (u32, u32) = (x + 1, x + 2)
```

Since Type-C supports anonymous functions and to avoid ambiguity within the compiler, the parenthesis are required to indicate the expressions enclosed are a tuple.

```tc
fn callAFunc(f: fn(x: u32) -> (u32, u32), x: u32) -> (u32, u32) = f(x)
```

## Tuples Values Unpacking
A single variable cannot hold a tuple, but you can unpack a tuple into multiple variables.

```tc
fn doStuff(x: u32) -> (u32, u32) = (x + 1, x + 2)

fn main() {
    let (a, b) = doStuff(1)
    io.println(a)
    io.println(b)
}
```

## Skipping Values During Unpacking

When reading values from a tuple, it is possible to use `_` to skip values.

```tc
fn doStuff(x: u32) -> (u32, u32, u32) = (x + 1, x + 2, x + 3)

fn main() {
    let (a, _, c) = doStuff(1)
    io.println(a)
    io.println(c)
}
```

## Return statement

When returning a tuple from within a function, the writing is the same if it is an expression function or a statement function declaration, here is a snippet showcasing both cases:

```tc
fn doStuff(x: u32) -> (u32, u32) {
    return (x+1, x+2)
}

// or

fn doStuff(x: u32) -> (u32, u32) = (x+1, x+2)
```

It is important to notice that the comma is used primarly as a separator within Type-C, meaning that stacking expression with a comma will generally result in a compile-time error. The only expection to this
is when returning a tuple from a function, meaning right after the function assignment or the return statement.
