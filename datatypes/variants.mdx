# Variants

Variants in Type-C are algebraic data types that provide an expressive way to represent multiple possible types within a
single type declaration. Unlike enums, variants can also include arguments, making them even more versatile.

```tc
type Tree = variant {
    Binary(lhs: Tree, rhs: Tree),
    Unary(uhs: Tree),
    Value(val: u32)
}

let t = Tree.Binary(
    Tree.Binary(
        Tree.Value(1),
        Tree.Unary(
            Tree.Value(4)
        )
    ),
    Tree.Unary(
        Tree.Value(10)
    )
)

fn sumTree(t: Tree) -> u32 = match t {
    Tree.Binary(lhs, rhs) => sumTree(lhs) + sumTree(rhs),
    Tree.Unary(uhs): Tree.Unary => sumTree(uhs),
    Tree.Value: Tree.Value => value.val
}
```

In the example, the `sumTree` function demonstrates how pattern matching works with variants, calculating the sum of
values within a tree structure. Type-C also supports generic variants, which adds another layer of flexibility.

```tc
type Tree<T> = variant {
    Binary(lhs: Tree<T>, rhs: Tree<T>),
    Unary(uhs: Tree<T>),
    Value(val: T)
}

let t = Tree.Binary(
    Tree.Binary(
        Tree.Value(0.13),
        Tree.Unary(
            Tree.Value(1.113)
        )
    ),
    Tree.Unary(
        Tree.Value(11.5)
    )
)

// Create an alias for simplicity
type FloatTree = Tree<f32>

fn sumTree(t: FloatTree) -> f32 = match t {
    FloatTree.Binary(lhs, rhs) => sumTree(lhs) + sumTree(rhs),
    FloatTree.Unary(uhs): Tree.Unary => sumTree(uhs),
    FloatTree.Value: Tree.Value => value.val
}
```
