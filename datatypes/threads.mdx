Threads DataType
===
The `thread<T>` type in Type-C represents a higher-level abstraction over operating system threads, designed to facilitate concurrent programming by executing code in parallel and eventually producing a result of type T. This model simplifies the creation and management of threads, making concurrency more accessible and safer.

## Syntax and Usage
The `thread<T>` type is used to declare variables that will hold references to asynchronous operations. The basic syntax for creating a new thread is:
```tc
let v: thread<ReturnType> = spawn someFunc(arguments)
```

- `spawn`: A keyword used to create a new thread that executes the specified function.
- `functionName(arguments)`: The function to be executed in the thread, along with its arguments.
- `ReturnType`: The type of the result that the thread will produce upon completion.

## Features
- **Type Safety**: The `thread<T>` type enforces compile-time type checking, ensuring that the result of the thread execution is of the expected type, enhancing code reliability and safety.
- **Simplified Concurrency Model**: By abstracting away the complexities of thread management, Type-C makes concurrent programming more accessible, allowing developers to focus on the logic rather than on synchronization and other low-level concerns.
- **Compatibility with Async/Await Pattern**: The `thread<T>` type integrates seamlessly with the async/await pattern, making it easier to write non-blocking code and to synchronize thread results in a clear and concise manner.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Resource Management**: Each instance of `thread<T>` consumes system resources. It's important to manage threads wisely, creating them when necessary and ensuring they complete to free up resources.
- **Error Handling**: Consideration should be given to how errors within a thread are handled and propagated to the caller, especially for operations that may fail.
- **Synchronization**: While `thread<T>` abstracts much of the complexity, understanding when to use synchronization primitives like Locks is still necessary to avoid data races and deadlocks.

## Example: Asynchronous File Processing

```tc
fn readFile(path: String) -> String {
    // Simulate reading a file
    return "file content"
}

fn processContent(content: String) -> usize {
    // Simulate processing file content
    return content.len()
}

fn asyncFileProcessingExample() {
    let contentThread: thread<String> = spawn readFile("path/to/file.txt")
    let content: String = await contentThread

    let processThread: thread<usize> = spawn processContent(content)
    let result: usize = await processThread

    println("Processed file length: ", result)
}
```

This example highlights how `thread<T>` can be used to perform IO-bound and CPU-bound operations concurrently, showcasing the flexibility and power of Type-C's concurrency model. Through this enriched documentation, developers can gain a deeper understanding of `thread<T>`, enabling them to leverage concurrency to build efficient and scalable Type-C applications.
