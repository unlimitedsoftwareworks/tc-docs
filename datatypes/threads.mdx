Threads DataType
===

There are two types of threads in type-c language, `threads` that are spawned using an expression, and `thread` that are spawned using a custom `thread` type.

## Case 1: Spawning an expression
Spawning an expression creates a new thread that runs concurrently with the current thread. The returned type however is not thread, but a `promise` that can be awaited.
Once the thread is finished, the promise is resolved with the return value of the thread.

## Case 2: Spawning an interactive thread

`thread<T>` type represents a thread that can be spawned and run concurrently. This is different from regular threads that return a promoise,
since these threads support communication between them.

```ts
type Worker = thread {
    fn on:fetch(url: string) -> string {
        // download some data ..
        return data
    }

    fn on:terminate() {
        this.terminate();
    }
}

let worker = spawn Worker();

// calling an event returns a promise
worker.fetch("https://example.com").then(fn(data) {
    println(data);
})

let data = await worker.fetch("https://example.com");
println(data);
```

`threads` are very similar to classes, in the sense that they can have their own states. But they are not to be confused with classes! They are very different entities.
Additionally, threads cannot be casted to any other types (even themselves, similar to classes in this aspect).
