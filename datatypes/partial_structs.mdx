Partial structs are structs that can be partially initialized. Partial structs are useful when you want to initialize
a struct with only a few fields, and set of default values for the rest.

Partial structs have great limitations compared to regular structs, when dealing with them.
The compiler doesn't assume the presence of any field in a partial struct, therefore a nullish coaslescing operator `??`
is required to access their fields.

```tc
type Point = {x: f64, y: f64}
let p: partial<Point> = {x: 1.0}
let y = p.y ?? 0.0
```

Since this is troublesome and verbose, it is possible to merge partial structs with regular structs.
Merging is done through `>>` or `<<` operator depending on which direction you want to merge.


```tc
type Point = {x: f64, y: f64}
let p1: partial<Point> = {x: f64}
let p2: Point = {x: 1.0, y: 2.0} << p // p2 = {x: 1.0, y: 2.0}
let p3: Point = p >> {x: 1.0, y: 2.0}
```
