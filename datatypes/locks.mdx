Locks
===

In my instances, it is often desired to share data between threads. Sharing in read-only mode is the recommended approach, however it doesn't solve all the problems. Generally speaking, a good practice is to have only one process write to a shared resource, and have multiple processes read from it. This is the case when you have a process that is responsible for writing to a file, and multiple processes that are responsible for reading from it. If you want to write to the same file from multiple resources, a lock is needed. Type-C provides built-in locks that can be used to synchronize access to shared resources.

```tc
/**
 * A cache to store files already downloaded
 * to avoid downloading the same file multiple times.
 */

let sharedMap = new Map<String, File>()
let l = new lock(sharedMap)

let downloader = fn(url: String) {
    await l.aquire()
    let file = l.get(url)
    if file == null {
        file = new File(url)
        file.download()
        l.set(url, file)
    }
    l.release()
}

fn main() {
    spawn downloader("http://example.com/file1")
    spawn downloader("http://example.com/file2")
    spawn downloader("http://example.com/file1")
}
```

Additionally, you can try using the call back function to grab the lock and avoid waiting for the lock to be released.

```tc
let downloader = fn(url: String) {
    l.withLock(fn (map: Map) {
        let file = map.get(url)
        if file == null {
            file = new File(url)
            file.download()
            map.set(url, file)
        }
    })
}
```

You can think of the type `lock` as the following interface:
```tc
type lock<T> = interface {
    /**
     * Requests a lock, returns a promise since the lock may
     * not be immediately available.
     */
    fn request() -> Promise<T>

    /**
     * Unlocks the lock. immediate.
     * Returns an error code to indicate if the task is successful
     */
    fn unlock() -> UnlockResponse

    /**
     * Executes a block of code with the lock requestd, 
     * unlocking it afterward. The function passed should 
     * return a Promise to allow asynchronous operations.
     */
    fn withLock(fn: (data: T) -> Promise<void>) -> Promise<void>
}
```
