Functions
===

In Type-C, functions are first-class citizens, embodying a core principle of the language's design that emphasizes flexibility and performance. There are two primary types of functions: `named functions` and `anonymous functions`. Each type serves unique purposes in Type-C programming, accommodating a wide range of programming patterns from structured module development to functional programming and callbacks.

## Named Functions

Named functions are defined using the `fn` keyword followed by an identifier. These functions are bound to their names in the current scope, making them easily referable. The syntax for defining a named function is as follows:

```tc
fn functionName(param1: Type1, param2: Type2, ...) -> ReturnType {
    // Function body
}
```

Named functions can be used for recurring operations, logically grouping code, or defining methods and behaviors in modules and classes.

## Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions, also known as lambda functions or lambda expressions, are defined without a name and can be used in any place where a function is expected. These functions are particularly useful for short-lived operations, such as callbacks, and for operations that don't require a named identifier. The syntax for an anonymous function is a simplified version of the named function, omitting the name:

```tc
fn(param1: Type1, param2: Type2, ...) -> ReturnType {
    // Function body
}
```

Anonymous functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables. This makes them a powerful tool for implementing functional programming concepts in Type-C, such as map/reduce operations, closures, and high-order functions.

## Function Return Type Inference
If a function doesn't have a specified return type, the compiler will attempt to infer it. This is done by analyzing the function body and determining the type of the value that the function returns. If the function has multiple return statements, the compiler will attempt to determine the common type. If the compiler is unable to infer the return type, an error will be thrown, and the return type must be explicitly specified.

Additionally, if a function is recursive or within a recursive chain with another function, the return type must be explicitly specified.

## Function Features

Both types of functions in Type-C share several advanced features:

- **Type Annotations**: Every function parameter can be annotated with its type, enhancing code readability and safety by enabling compile-time type checking.
- **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables. This promotes a functional programming approach, allowing for powerful abstractions and modular code design.
- **Closures**: Functions can capture and carry with them some context from their scope. This is particularly useful for creating function factories and maintaining state in a functional style.

## Expression Functions

In Type-C a function body can be written as a simple expression if the function doesn't require very sophisticated logic. This is called an `expression function`. The syntax for an expression function is as follows:

```tc
fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 = match n {
    0 => 0,
    1 => 1,
    _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}
```

## Function Overloading
It is possible to overload functions, with some limitations.

1. Functions must have different argument types. Return types does not count towards the signature
2. Overloaded functions must be within the same scope

```tc
// from std.math

from std.vm_api.stdmath import MathAPI

fn abs(x: f64) -> f64 {
    return MathAPI.absd(x)
}

fn abs (x: f32) -> f32 {
    return MathAPI.absf(x)
}
```

## Notes:

1. Variadic arguments are not support in Type-C (Variadic functions are functions that can take a variable number of arguments).
2. Argument mutability can be specified using the `mut` keyword, and is **part of the function signature**, and **must be respected**.
3. Function Return Type must be specied when used within a recursive context, inference engine will fail to infer the type if not specified.
