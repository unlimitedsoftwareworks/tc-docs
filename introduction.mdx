# Introduction

Type-C is a work in progress programming language, with the following goals in mind:
1. Speed: Type-C's runtime aims to be fast and efficient
2. Safety: Type-C aims to be safe
3. Expressive: Type-C aims to be expressive and productive

Type-C is a modern take of C programming language but for general purpose programming.
It is inspired by languages such as Javascript, Typescript, C.

        <b>Note from the author:</b>
        Type-C doesn't aim to replace any other language. I do not claim that Type-C to be better, faster or safer than any other language.
        With Type-C, I am implementing my own ideas and concepts, and I am sharing them with the world.
        If you think Type-C is cool, then I am happy to hear that. If you think Type-C I would appreciate **constructive feedback**.

While Type-C shared few similarities with C, but it is not a superset of C. It is a new language with its own syntax and semantics.
Some C concepts still applied, such as arguments and upvalues being passed by values and not reference.
