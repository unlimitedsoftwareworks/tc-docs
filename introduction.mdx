# Introduction

Type-C is (or aims to be)a versatile and high-performance programming language tailored for performance-intensive applications, such as user interfaces, 
games, and web services, etc. While Type-C can be embedded in various applications as a scripting language or run on resource-constrained
 devices, its goal is to truly excels in scenarios where speed and efficiency are paramount. It is designed with a clear philosophy and specific goals, 
 which may resonate with some developers and not with others. The language draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including C, Java, and TypeScript. 
 TypeScript's powerful type inference engine, Java's structure, and C's straightforwardness have all played a role in shaping Type-C. The primary aim of 
 Type-C is to offer an enjoyable, expressive, and efficient programming experience. While it does not prioritize top-notch real-time performance or the 
 absolute simplicity of writing, it enforces specific design patterns that contribute to robust and maintainable enterprise-grade software (hopefully).


At the time of writing, Type-C is still in the early stages of development, and the language is not yet fully implemented. The overall
project is structured into a compiler written in TypeScript and a VM written in C.

### Language Features
Majority of the language features are already implemented, with some basic unit testing, But some features are still missing

The missing features are:
- [ ] Proper errors
- [ ] Modules
- [ ] Struct/Array Destructuring `[1, 2, ...c]`
- [ ] Closures
- [ ] Coroutines
- [ ] Concurrency
- [ ] IR optimizations

### VM Features
It is hard to enumerate the features of the VM, so i will jump right away into the missing ones:
- [ ] Templates (also need to be implemented in the compiler)
- [ ] Garbage Collector
- [ ] Assembler
- [ ] Disassembler
- [ ] Debugger
- [ ] JIT Compiler (long shot)
