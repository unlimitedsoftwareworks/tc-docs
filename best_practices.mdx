Type-C offers a lot of features, but it's important to use them wisely. Here are some best practices to keep in mind:

## Class or Struct?
The choice between a class and struct is rather straight forward.
If you need to model hidden state, use a class. If the fields are independent of each other, use a struct.

For example:
```tc
type Point = struct {
    x: u32
    y: u32
}
```

The fields of the struct are independent of each other, so it makes sense to use a struct.

```tc
type Str = struct {
    data: u8[],
    len: u32
}
```

The `len` field is dependent on the `data` field, so it makes sense to use a class, and encapsulate the logic to update the `len` field for example
