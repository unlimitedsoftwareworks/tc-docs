# Coroutines as Data Types

Coroutines are a type of function that can be paused and resumed. They are similar to lua coroutines.

Coroutines are built-in data types, their usage is almost identical to regular functions, except that they can be accessed as objects (they are not object per se!)

## Declaration

```tc
let f = fn() -> u32 = {
    let x: u32 = 0
    while true {
        x = x + 1
        return x
    }
}

let g = coroutine(f())
```

Once a coroutine returns, it will need to be manually called again to continue execution. It can return values or no values at all.

## Life Cycle

Coroutines can have the following state:
- `created`: The coroutine is created but not yet executed.
- `running`: The coroutine is running.
- `suspended`: The coroutine is suspended.
- `dead`: The coroutine is dead.

## Example

```tc
let f = fn() -> u32 = {
    let x: u32 = 0
    while true {
        x = x + 1
        return x
    }
}

let iterator = coroutine(f())
io.println(iterator.state) # created

let z = iterator()
let a = iterator()
```


## Arguments

Coroutines can take arguments just like regular functions, these are argument may not change during the coroutine's execution.

```tc
let f = fn(x: u32[]) -> (u32, bool) = {
    let i = 0
    while true {
        return (x[i], i++ == x.length)

        if i == x.length {
            i = 0
        }
    }
}

let g = coroutine(f, [1, 2, 3, 4])

let loop = true
while loop {
    let (x, done) = g()
    io.println(x)
    if done {
        loop = false
    }
}
```
