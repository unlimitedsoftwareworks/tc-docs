  <span>The current setup unfortunately requires building everything from source. A better setup will be available as soon good progress is made.</span>

## Installation

Type-C setup currently involves manual work as the the language has not been officially release yet.
Hence, we will need to manually install the following:
- Type-C Compiler: A typescript project, requires node & npm
- Type-V: Type-C Virtual Machine, built in C11 requires GCC/Clang, CMake
- Standard Library: Type-C stdlib lib, no requirements.


### 1. Install Type-V

#### Prerequisite:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unlimitedsoftwareworks/type-v
```

#### MacOS:
```bash

cd type-v
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### Ubuntu:
On ubuntu you need to add the following compiler directive to the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root `type-v` directory:
```
...
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)

# ADD THESE:
add_definitions(-D_ISOC11_SOURCE)
add_definitions(-D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L)

# regular content
add_subdirectory(stdio)
add_subdirectory(string)
...
```

The reason for this, is the VM using `C11` features such as `aligned_alloc` and `strdup`.
This will be replace with `mi_malloc` soon enough, but for now, they cause sanitizers errors so i had it off.

`clang` is recommended over `gcc` as the performance gains tested on Linux are significant.

```bash
cd type-v
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++  ..
make
```

#### Windows:
Untested.

#### Postrequisite:
Export the path to the `type-v` folder as `TYPE_V_PATH` in your environment.

```sh
export TYPE_V_PATH=/path/to/type-v/build
```

### 2. Install stdlib

```sh
git clone https://github.com/unlimitedsoftwareworks/stdlib
```

Export the path to the `stdlib` folder as `TYPE_C_STDLIB` in your environment.

```sh
export TYPE_C_STDLIB=/path/to/type-c/stdlib
```

### 3: Install Type-C

Either clone this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/unlimitedsoftwareworks/type-c
yarn
yarn build
```

with `dist/index.js` being the entry point for the CLI

Or

```sh
npm install -g @unlimitedsoftwareworks/type-c
```
You can now use the `typec` command in your terminal. Type `typec --help` for more information.

Remember you need to have both `TYPE_V_PATH` and `TYPE_C_STDLIB` exported in your environment.

```sh
typec -c ./tests/test11 -o ./output --generate-ir --run
```

**Both `TYPE_V_PATH` and `TYPE_C_STDLIB` should point to directories**


## Creating a Project


#### Use CLI:
If you have installed the CLI, you can create a new project with the following command:
```sh
typec init [path]
```
This will create the folder if needed, and create a `module.json` and `main.tc` files in the folder.

#### Manual:
To create a new project, we will need to create a new folder, and create a `module.json` file. This file contains the project compiler settings, dependencies, search path, etc.
```json
{
    "name": "Type-C Sample",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "Replace with your name",
    "dependencies": [],
    "description": "A type-c test case",
    "compiler": {
        "target": "runnable",
        "entry": "main.tc"
    }
}
```

As for now, only the `compiler.entry` field is used. This field specifies the entry point of the project.


## Running the project:
First compiling the project with type-c compiler: `node outs/index.js -c [path-to-module.json folder] -o [output-directory]`
Then run the output with the type-v virtual machine: `./type-v [output-directory]/bin.tvb [output-directory]/src_map.map.txt`

The `src_map.map.txt` file is generated by the compiler and contains the source map to be able to trace crashes.
