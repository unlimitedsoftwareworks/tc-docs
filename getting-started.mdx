  <span>The current setup unfortunately requires building everything from source. A better setup will be available as soon good progress is made.</span>

## Installation

Type-C setup currently involves manual work as the the language has not been officially release yet.
Hence, we will need to manually install the following:
- Type-C Compiler: A typescript project, requires node & npm
- Type-V: Type-C Virtual Machine, built in C11 requires GCC/Clang, CMake
- Standard Library: Type-C stdlib lib, no requirements.

```bash
mkdir type-c && cd type-c
git clone https://github.com/unlimitedsoftwareworks/type-c.git
git clone https://github.com/unlimitedsoftwareworks/type-v.git
git clone https://github.com/unlimitedsoftwareworks/stdlib
```

## Building the compiler:
```bash
cd type-c
npm install
npx tsc
```

## Building the Virtual Machine:
```bash
# from the base type-c directory
cd type-v
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Creating a Project
To create a new project, we will need to create a new folder, and create a `module.json` file. This file contains the project compiler settings, dependencies, search path, etc.
```json
{
    "name": "Type-C Sample",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "praisethemoon",
    "dependencies": [],
    "description": "A type-c test case",
    "compiler": {
        "target": "runnable",
        "entry": "test.tc"
    }
}
```

The directory of this file is the default project directory. All imports will be resolved from there. Hence within files in subdirectory, importing packages from current module will be resolved from the project root directory.

## Running the project:
First compiling the project with type-c compiler: `node outs/index.js -c [path-to-module.json folder] -o [output-directory]`
Then run the output with the type-v virtual machine: `./type-v [output-directory]/bin.tvb`
