Type-C Limitations
===

Despite all of these features, types-c does offer some limitations that are important to be aware of.
Some of these limitations will be improved in the near future, some will not.

- Maximum number of arguments to a function is 256
- Maximum number of class attributes is 256
- Maximum number of struct fields is 256
- No spilling at runtime, failure to allocate registers will result in a compile-time error, with error `Function too complex`.
