Type-C offers a lot of features, but it's important to use them wisely. Here are some best practices to keep in mind:

## Class or Struct?
The choice between a class and struct is rather straight forward.
If you need to model hidden state, use a class. If the fields are independent of each other, use a struct.

For example:
```tc
type Point = struct {
    x: u32
    y: u32
}
```

The fields of the struct are independent of each other, so it makes sense to use a struct.

```tc
type Str = struct {
    data: u8[],
    len: u32
}
```

The `len` field is dependent on the `data` field, so it makes sense to use a class, and encapsulate the logic to update the `len` field for example

## Classes vs Interfaces
Type-C encourages interface usage, a lot. It is recommended to program around interfaces for a vareity of reasons, but most importantly, flexibility.
Hence, it is recommended to use factory pattern for classes rather than `new` keyword, and return an interface instead.

Example:
```tc
type Object3D = interface {
    fn render() -> void
}

type Cube = class {
    static fn create() -> Object3D {
        return new Cube()
    }

    fn init() -> void {
        this.size = [1, 1, 1]
    }

    fn render() -> void {
        // render cube
    }
}
```

This pattern is heavily used in the standard library, and is recommended.
It is not recommended to make constructors private without reason.
